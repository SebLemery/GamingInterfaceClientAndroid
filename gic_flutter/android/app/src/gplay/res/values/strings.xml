        The Gaming Interface Client application on android will remain free and open source, and you can find more details at the link below!<br/><br/>
        However, if you like the work that I\'ve done and would like to support continued development and features, you can send me a donation using one of the options below!<br/><br/>
        As a small way of saying thank you, you will also see a icon on the main screen showing off your support!<br/><br/>
        <br/><br/><strong>If you have reinstalled the application, you'll need to load this screen once to see the flair appear on your main screen.</strong>
        Thank you - Terence<br/><br/>
